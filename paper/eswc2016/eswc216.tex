\begin{abstract}

Airbus, one of the leading Aircraft company in Europe, collects and manages  a substantial amount of unstructured data from airlines companies, related to events occurring during the exploitation of an aircraft. Those events are called ``Operational Interruptions'' (OI) describing observations, such as ``noises in the radio'' and the work performed associated by an operator, like ``I have replaced the component''. At the same time, Airbus maintains a dataset of programmed maintenance task (MPD) for each family of aircraft.  Currently, the information of the OIs is gathered in Excel spreadsheets and experts have to find manually in the OIs the ones that are most likely to match an existing task. In this paper, we describe a semi-automatic approach using semantic technologies to assist the experts of the domain to improve the matching process of OIs with related MPD. Our approach combines text annotation using GATE based on an RDF model and a graph matching algorithm using SPARQL, thanks to the datasets converted in RDF. The evaluation of the approach shows the benefits of using semantic technologies to manage unstructured data at Airbus.

\section{Manual Curation of Domain vocabularies}
\label{sec:curation}

Take a vocab, look at the content and classes..manual identification of the domain.. assignment and/or creation of the domain in LOV backend. Applications: visual in the front-end and in the results page.
